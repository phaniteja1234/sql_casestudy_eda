#### In this project, we leveraged the power of SQL to perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on a laptop database. The laptop database contains information about various laptop models, including their specifications, prices, and ratings. By using SQL queries, we explored the properties of the dataset, identified potential errors or inconsistencies, and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis. Additionally, we used SQL queries to extract valuable insights from the data, such as identifying the most popular laptop brands, the highest-rated laptops in a particular price range, or the average price of laptops with specific specifications.
#### Overall, the use of SQL queries in this project enabled us to efficiently explore and preprocess the data and derive meaningful insights that can inform business decisions. By leveraging the power of SQL, we were able to conduct a thorough analysis of the laptop database and gain valuable insights into the laptop market that can help businesses make informed decisions and stay competitive.
